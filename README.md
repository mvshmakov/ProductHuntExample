# ProductHuntExample
Test task implementation for juntoteam.

Simple Android client for ProductHunt.com made with usage of RESTful API and 4 libs: Gson for parsing JSON, Retrofit for HTTP requests,
RecyclerView for the purpose of list of posts creation and Picasso for parsing screenshots (remained unused yet). Main activity includes
few fragments for navigation.

I was thinking of notifications as an API JSON answer from server and about pull to refresh as SwipeRefreshLayout implemented to 
RecyclerView in every fragment I have.

Application still is uncompleted and imperfect.
