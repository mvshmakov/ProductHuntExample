# ProductHuntExample
Test task implementation for juntoteam.

Simple Android client for ProductHunt.com made with useage of RESTful API and 4 libs: Gson for parsing JSON, Retrofit for HTTP requests,
RecyclerView for the purpose of posts list creation and Picasso for parsing screenshots (remained unused yet).

Application still is uncompleted and imperfect.
